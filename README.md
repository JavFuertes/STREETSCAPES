# Streetscapes

Streets are classified based on their role in vehicle movement (Su et al., 2022), considering factors like lane number and width, vehicle speed, and type. However, this approach often overlooks the street's context and its function as a social space. Alternative classification methods that integrate both "movement" and "place" aspects are needed. With advancements in deep learning and access to millions of street view images, there is potential to enhance street classification. Images provide richer information than numerical databases, and deep learning models can analyze them more quickly than field observations.

> The primary objective of this project is to create a deep learning model that can automatically classify street features by analyzing computer vision embeddings. It aims to be solved via unsupervised and transfer learning to remove the reliance on labeled data and thus make it transferable to different locations.

## 🏗️ Module Structure

The repo is split into two submodules:

### 🏙️ `streetscapes.models`

- `vit.py`: Transfer learning ImageNet Vision transformer without classifier for feature extraction 
- **Dimensionality reduction**: Two reduction models:
  - `pca.py`: Principal Component Analysis
  - `vae.py`: Variational Auto Encoder (Encoder Only)
- **Classifiers**: Two unsupervised classification models:
  - `km.py`: KMeans classifier
  - `gm.py`: Guassian Mixture

### 🔧 `streetscapes.processing`

- Scripts neccessary to process the images, analyse the features, and plot the data
